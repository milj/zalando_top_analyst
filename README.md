# zalando_top_analyst

This repository will contain my solutions to the "Zalando's Next Top Analyst" data science teaser problem.

The original description of the problem can be found in the [problem_statement](problem_statement/) folder.

Problems like this are usually solved in Python, R or Matlab. However, my first approach
will be in Ruby, with additional help of `gnuplot` for plotting. The rationale behind this is two-fold.
First, I have used Ruby for a long time for web development but I have never used it
for numerical computations. I'm very keen to give it a try.
Second, there is no numpy/scipy equivalent for Ruby so I will have to stay "close to the metal" and
hopefully get a deep understanding of the problem and all the little steps that lead to the
search area plotted on a map.
